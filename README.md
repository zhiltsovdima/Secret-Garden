**Tech Stack:** Swift, UIKit, MVVM-C, CocoaPods, FireBase, FileManager, RxSwift

**Description:** This app allows you to create and manage a personal collection of plants. You can add plants to your collection by either taking a photo or selecting an image from your photo library. The app then downloads relevant information about the plant from the internet, its features. Also you can upload various plants from the shop, filter by category, view detailed information and add to your cart or to your favourites.

**Features:**
  - MVVM-C architecture to separate concerns and improve code organization
  - CocoaPods for managing third-party dependencies
  - Custom UI elements using UIKit
  - Dark mode support
  - Current Weather fetching
  - Fetching freshing news from my API
  - Using RxSwift for some parts of the app
  - Using GCD to manage tasks
  - Downloading images from Camera/PhotoLibrary
  - Download data for added plants from the internet
  - Store user's plant data in the FileManager
  - Upload and retrieve shop data from Firebase
  - Some unit tests included
  - Design, AppIcon, LaunchScreen

**List of things planned for implementation:**
  - SearchBar implementation
  - Improve the use of the coordinator pattern
  - UX/UI improvements
  - Greater percentage of test coverage
  - Continue to implement the potential of RxSwift 

  In the long run:
  - Add a plant watering reminder
  - Add a note diary for the plant(with more photos)
  - Visual effects of adding to cart/favorites
  - CoreML (plant recognizer, search or creation a small coreML model)
  - Further developing the shoping cart(maybe)
